To integrate GitHub into the N8N workflow, you first need to set up a GitHub account in N8N, creating new credentials with login information and approving access. With this setup, you can create tasks on GitHub, where you must select the repository and owner, as well as define the title, body, tags, and assignees. Clarity and conciseness in the information are essential for easy understanding of the tasks.

When a card's priority is high, the N8N workflow automatically routes that task to Trello, which requires proper priority configuration for effective management. Adding tags, such as "high priority" or "bug," helps categorize tasks, making organization and prioritization easier.

During workflow execution, if a critical error occurs, it's important to review the submitted data, as many problems arise from missing or incorrect information. Testing the workflow with sample data can help identify and correct errors before final execution. To ensure the workflow functions correctly, each part must be tested individually, verifying that all nodes are configured correctly and that credentials are valid.

The project demonstrates the integration of N8N with platforms such as Trello and Google Sheets, showing how to create a card on GitHub and the importance of maintaining a reference to the previous workflow. The demonstration illustrates the creation of an issue, the addition of comments, and the editing of information, highlighting the effectiveness of N8N in integrating with different platforms and its ease of use.

Finally, to update an issue on GitHub, simply access the desired issue and make the necessary changes, saving them for application. The configuration of a Form Submission node in N8N is also mentioned, allowing the collection of form data and its integration into the workflow, facilitating process automation. The project concludes by demonstrating the successful creation of the issue on GitHub, with all information correctly assigned.
